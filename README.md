# Welcome to Brownian 

This repository is a personal collection of simulation experiments — from physics to pattern formation — written in **Python** and **Julia**. It's a space where I implement and visualize any simulation idea that sparks my curiosity.

###  What's Inside
-  **Turing Patterns** – reaction-diffusion systems and pattern emergence (Postponed)
-  **Wave Simulations** – 1D/2D wave equations in motion (work in progress)
-  **Kolmogorov Flow Simulation** – currently in progress 

- More to come: fluid dynamics, cellular automata, particle systems...

###  Tools & Languages
- **Python** – NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy  
- **Julia** – Makie.jl, DifferentialEquations.jl, FFTW.jl

###  Notes
This is a constantly evolving project — not all simulations are polished, but each one reflects something I wanted to understand by building it.

Feel free to suggest cool systems to simulate!
